# 🏓 Ping Pong Game


I built a modern version of the classic Pong game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This project upgrades the retro arcade experience with a professional UI and new features:




🎮 Features

-Stylish scoreboard with player labels

-Game Over overlay with winner announcement

-Countdown (3…2…1…GO!) before every round

-Play Again button for quick restart

-Sound effects (paddle hit, wall bounce, scoring, game over)

-Background music with floating Mute/Unmute button

-Gradient background + neon paddles for a catchy arcade look



🚀 How to Play

1.Use the keyboard arrows (⬆️ ⬇️) or key (W, S) to move the paddle.

2.Bounce the ball back using the paddle.

3.Try not to let the ball pass your paddle or it's game over!



🚀 Tech Stack

-HTML5 Canvas for rendering

-CSS3 for UI styling (scoreboard, buttons, icons)

-JavaScript (ES6) for game logic & animations



✨ This project showcases creative game development with vanilla JavaScript while keeping performance smooth and design modern.
